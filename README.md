# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise's play *Fever* came close to completing it's fundraising goal. She is curious about other theatre kickstarters and how they did based on their launch date and fundraising goals. Given a dataset of kickstarter campaigns by Louise, we are going to create new columns, pivot tables, and charts to help visualize the kickstarters to her liking. In doing so we will sharpen our Microsoft Excel data management and visualization skills. 

## Analysis and Challenges
